        My name is Nisha, and I am a dedicated web developer with a passion for creating engaging and user-friendly websites. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I specialize in building responsive applications using modern frameworks like React and Next.js. I enjoy the challenge of turning complex problems into simple, beautiful solutions, and I thrive in collaborative environments where I can learn from others and share my knowledge. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies or honing my skills in design and user experience..
